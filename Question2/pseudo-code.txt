Question 2
Implement a parking-lot management for large, multi-level parking facilities that optimises the use of spaces and 
improves the flow of traffic within the lot. This system should categorize spaces for different vehicle types, 
integrate automated payment and ticketing systems, and provide real-time information to drivers about available 
parking spaces. The goal is to minimise the time drivers spend searching for parking, enhance revenue from 
efficient space utilisation, and improve the overall user experience.

Inputs: A hashmap tcontaining parking lot details, a hashmap containing vehicle details, parking lot fee amount.

Process
1. Define parking lot structure like Number of spaces per lot
2. Categorize spaces by vehicle type (e.g., car, motorcycle, truck)
3. For every vehicle that comes in, assign the nearest available space that matches the vehicle type.
4. Mark assigned space as occupied
5. Update available spaces.
6. Calculate parking fee based on duration and space type.
7. If amount paid equals the parking fee, update ticket status to “paid”.
8. Mark the parking space as available.
9. Repeat step 5.

Outputs: strings of success or error messages.
